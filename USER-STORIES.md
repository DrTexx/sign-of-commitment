# Sign of Commitment - User Stories

As a committer, I want any commits I make to a [`CCHS-Melbourne`](https://github.com/cchs-melbourne) repository to show up on the LED matrix.

As a member of the Hackerspace, I want to see when other people make commits to `CCHS-Melbourne` projects to gain inspiration and also get insight into what people are working on.

As a guest visiting the space, I want to be able to know what people are working on, even if I might be too shy to ask.
